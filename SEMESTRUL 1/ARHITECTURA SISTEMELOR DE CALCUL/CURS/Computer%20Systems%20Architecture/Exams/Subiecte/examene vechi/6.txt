a:niste linii de cod sursa si tre sa spui daca-i correct sau sintax error sa logical error(de ex: mov si,dword ptr [bx+6]
b:replace the following code sequence with a single asm instruction:
cmp ax,not -1
js et1
mov dx, -1 eq 255
jmp go2
et1: mov dl,3 or 4
mov dh, 2 shl 2
and dh,dl
mov dl, -1
xor dh, dl
go2:
4:A string of doubleword is given build a string of bite in the following way:
take the most significant byte of the least least significant word of each doubleword and if it is strictly negative than put it into the string. After that write your string of bites on the screen in base 2.
Ex: sir dd 12345678h,1234abcdh,FF00FE33h
your string should look like: AB,FE
You should print on the screen: 1010 1011 1111 1110(no space needed beetwen the number)
